# Audio Distorter
This program takes in a path to a file and saves a new file with worse audio quality (more specifically, it uses ffmpeg to output a new file at a 4 kilobit bitrate).

## Prerequisites
### ffmpeg
https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
Select the download appropriate for your operating system.
### Python 3.13
Other versions probably work but this was built and tested on Python 3.13.

#### Libraries Used
audioop-lts v0.2.1
future v1.0.0
numpy v2.2.3
pip v25.0.1
pydub v0.25.1
Support for a simple install with libraries included WIP.
